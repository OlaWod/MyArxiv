This paper presents Vec-Tok\nSpeech, an extensible framework that resembles multiple speech generation\ntasks, generating expressive and high-fidelity speech. Specifically, we propose\na novel speech codec based on speech vectors and semantic tokens. Speech\nvectors contain acoustic details contributing to high-fidelity speech\nreconstruction, while semantic tokens focus on the linguistic content of\nspeech, facilitating language modeling. Based on the proposed speech codec,\nVec-Tok Speech leverages an LM to undertake the core of speech generation.\nMoreover, Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) is introduced to reduce the token length and\nbit rate for lower exposure bias and longer context coverage, improving the\nperformance of LMs. Vec-Tok Speech can be used for intra- and cross-lingual\nzero-shot voice conversion (VC), zero-shot speaking style transfer\ntext-to-speech (TTS), speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), speech denoising,\nand speaker de-identification and anonymization.

Despite an annual burden of over 1.5\nmillion infant deaths and disabilities, early detection of neonatal brain\ninjuries due to asphyxia remains a challenge, particularly in developing\ncountries where the majority of births are not attended by a trained physician.\nHere we report on the first inter-continental clinical study to demonstrate\nthat neonatal brain injury can be reliably determined from recorded infant\ncries using an AI algorithm we call Roseline. Previous and recent work has been\nlimited by the lack of a large, high-quality clinical database of cry\nrecordings, constraining the application of state-of-the-art machine learning.\nWe develop a new training methodology for audio-based pathology detection\nmodels and evaluate this system on a large database of newborn cry sounds\nacquired from geographically diverse settings -- 5 hospitals across 3\ncontinents. Our system extracts interpretable acoustic biomarkers that support\nclinical decisions and is able to accurately detect neurological injury from\nnewborns' cries with an AUC of 92.5% (88.7% sensitivity at 80% specificity).\nCry-based neurological monitoring opens the door for low-cost, easy-to-use,\nnon-invasive and contact-free screening of at-risk babies, especially when\nintegrated into simple devices like smartphones or neonatal ICU monitors.

In contrast, we address this problem from an effective\nrepresentation learning perspective, aiming to model the contribution of each\nmodality explicitly.

Their shared information corresponds to the target sound\nproducer(s) shown in the visual data. In this case, cross-modal shared\nrepresentation learning is especially important for AVS. To achieve this, our\nECMVAE factorizes the representations of each modality with a modality-shared\nrepresentation and a modality-specific representation. An orthogonality\nconstraint is applied between the shared and specific representations to\nmaintain the exclusive attribute of the factorized latent code. Further, a\nmutual information maximization regularizer is introduced to achieve extensive\nexploration of each modality.

By adapting the conventional target speaker voice activity\ndetection for real-time operation, this framework can identify speaker\nactivities using self-generated embeddings, resulting in consistent performance\nwithout permutation inconsistencies in the inference phase. During the\ninference process, we employ a front-end model to extract the frame-level\nspeaker embeddings for each coming block of a signal. Next, we predict the\ndetection state of each speaker based on these frame-level speaker embeddings\nand the previously estimated target speaker embedding. Then, the target speaker\nembeddings are updated by aggregating these frame-level speaker embeddings\naccording to the predictions in the current block. Our model predicts the\nresults for each block and updates the target speakers' embeddings until\nreaching the end of the signal. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms the offline clustering-based diarization system on the\nDIHARD III and AliMeeting datasets.

The NR model trained using CORN has access to a reference\nrecording during training, and thus, as one would expect, it consistently\noutperforms baseline NR models trained independently. Perhaps even more\nremarkable is that the CORN FR model also outperforms its baseline counterpart,\neven though it relies on the same training data and the same model\narchitecture.

However, even state-of-the-art ASR systems experience\nperformance degradation when confronted with adverse conditions, as a\nwell-trained acoustic model is sensitive to variations in the speech domain,\ne.g., background noise. Intuitively, humans address this issue by relying on\ntheir linguistic knowledge: the meaning of ambiguous spoken terms is usually\ninferred from contextual cues thereby reducing the dependency on the auditory\nsystem. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the first open-source\nbenchmark to utilize external large language models (LLMs) for ASR error\ncorrection, where N-best decoding hypotheses provide informative elements for\ntrue transcription prediction. This approach is a paradigm shift from the\ntraditional language model rescoring strategy that can only select one\ncandidate hypothesis as the output transcription. The proposed benchmark\ncontains a novel dataset, HyPoradise (HP), encompassing more than 334,000 pairs\nof N-best hypotheses and corresponding accurate transcriptions across prevalent\nspeech domains. Given this dataset, we examine three types of error correction\ntechniques based on LLMs with varying amounts of labeled\nhypotheses-transcription pairs, which gains a significant word error rate (WER)\nreduction. Experimental evidence demonstrates the proposed technique achieves a\nbreakthrough by surpassing the upper bound of traditional re-ranking based\nmethods.

However, even state-of-the-art ASR systems experience\nperformance degradation when confronted with adverse conditions, as a\nwell-trained acoustic model is sensitive to variations in the speech domain,\ne.g., background noise. Intuitively, humans address this issue by relying on\ntheir linguistic knowledge: the meaning of ambiguous spoken terms is usually\ninferred from contextual cues thereby reducing the dependency on the auditory\nsystem. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the first open-source\nbenchmark to utilize external large language models (LLMs) for ASR error\ncorrection, where N-best decoding hypotheses provide informative elements for\ntrue transcription prediction. This approach is a paradigm shift from the\ntraditional language model rescoring strategy that can only select one\ncandidate hypothesis as the output transcription. The proposed benchmark\ncontains a novel dataset, HyPoradise (HP), encompassing more than 334,000 pairs\nof N-best hypotheses and corresponding accurate transcriptions across prevalent\nspeech domains. Given this dataset, we examine three types of error correction\ntechniques based on LLMs with varying amounts of labeled\nhypotheses-transcription pairs, which gains a significant word error rate (WER)\nreduction. Experimental evidence demonstrates the proposed technique achieves a\nbreakthrough by surpassing the upper bound of traditional re-ranking based\nmethods.

In this work, we propose to leverage large language\nmodels (LLMs) and lists of hypotheses generated by an ASR to address the CS\nproblem.

Next, we utilize the LLMs to\nlearn the hypotheses-to-transcription (H2T) mapping by adding a trainable\nlow-rank adapter. Such a generative error correction (GER) method directly\npredicts the accurate transcription according to its expert linguistic\nknowledge and N-best hypotheses, resulting in a paradigm shift from the\ntraditional language model rescoring or error correction techniques.\nExperimental evidence demonstrates that GER significantly enhances CS-ASR\naccuracy, in terms of reduced mixed error rate (MER).

The word-level ASR fallibility score,\nrepresenting the likelihood of ASR mis-recognition, is defined and shaped as a\nprior word distribution to guide the LM training. To enable correction focused\ntraining with text-only corpora, large language models (LLMs) are employed as\nfallibility score predictors and text generators through multi-task\nfine-tuning. Experimental results for domain adaptation tasks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method. Compared with conventional LMs,\ncorrection focused training achieves up to relatively 5.5% word error rate\n(WER) reduction in sufficient text scenarios. In insufficient text scenarios,\nLM training with LLM-generated text achieves up to relatively 13% WER\nreduction, while correction focused training further obtains up to relatively\n6% WER reduction.\n","authors":["Yingyi Ma","Zhe Liu","Ozlem Kalinli"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11003v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09623v2","updated":"2023-10-17T05:08:47Z","published":"2023-09-18T09:52:54Z","title":"HumTrans: A Novel Open-Source Dataset for Humming Melody Transcription\n  and Beyond","summary":"  This paper introduces the HumTrans dataset, which is publicly available and\nprimarily designed for humming melody transcription.

Despite the recent advances in automatic\nspeech recognition (ASR), CS-ASR is still a challenging task ought to the\ngrammatical structure complexity of the phenomenon and the data scarcity of\nspecific training corpus. In this work, we propose to leverage large language\nmodels (LLMs) and lists of hypotheses generated by an ASR to address the CS\nproblem. Specifically, we first employ multiple well-trained ASR models for\nN-best hypotheses generation, with the aim of increasing the diverse and\ninformative elements in the set of hypotheses. Next, we utilize the LLMs to\nlearn the hypotheses-to-transcription (H2T) mapping by adding a trainable\nlow-rank adapter. Such a generative error correction (GER) method directly\npredicts the accurate transcription according to its expert linguistic\nknowledge and N-best hypotheses, resulting in a paradigm shift from the\ntraditional language model rescoring or error correction techniques.\nExperimental evidence demonstrates that GER significantly enhances CS-ASR\naccuracy, in terms of reduced mixed error rate (MER). Furthermore, LLMs show\nremarkable data efficiency for H2T learning, providing a potential solution to\nthe data scarcity problem of CS-ASR in low-resource languages.\n","authors":["Chen Chen","Yuchen Hu","Chao-Han Huck Yang","Hexin Liu","Sabato Marco Siniscalchi","Eng Siong Chng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13013v1.pdf","comment":"Submitted to ICASSP2024"}]},"2023-10-14T00:00:00Z":{"Sound":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09653v1","updated":"2023-10-14T19:51:17Z","published":"2023-10-14T19:51:17Z","title":"SelfVC: Voice Conversion With Iterative Refinement using Self\n  Transformations","summary":"  We propose SelfVC, a training strategy to iteratively improve a voice\nconversion model with self-synthesized examples.

The lack of sizeable\nlabelled datasets hinders speech-processing research across languages. Recent\nadvances in contrastive learning provide self-supervised techniques to learn\nfrom unlabelled data. Motivated by reducing data dependence and improving\ngeneralisation across diverse languages and conditions, we develop a\nmultilingual contrastive framework. This framework enables models to acquire\nshared representations across languages, facilitating cross-lingual transfer\nwith limited target language data.\n  Additionally, capturing emotional cues within speech is challenging due to\nsubjective perceptual assessments.

Recent\nadvances in contrastive learning provide self-supervised techniques to learn\nfrom unlabelled data. Motivated by reducing data dependence and improving\ngeneralisation across diverse languages and conditions, we develop a\nmultilingual contrastive framework. This framework enables models to acquire\nshared representations across languages, facilitating cross-lingual transfer\nwith limited target language data.\n  Additionally, capturing emotional cues within speech is challenging due to\nsubjective perceptual assessments.

This paradigm shows\nremarkable generalization ability on numerous downstream tasks across various\nmodalities. However, the reliance on massive high-quality data pairs limits its\nfurther development on more modalities. This paper proposes a novel\ntraining-efficient method for learning MCR without paired data called\nConnecting Multi-modal Contrastive Representations (C-MCR). Specifically, given\ntwo existing MCRs pre-trained on (A, B) and (B, C) modality pairs, we project\nthem to a new space and use the data from the overlapping modality B to\naligning the two MCRs in the new space. Meanwhile, since the modality pairs (A,\nB) and (B, C) are already aligned within each MCR, the connection learned by\noverlapping modality can also be transferred to non-overlapping modality pair\n(A, C). To unleash the potential of C-MCR, we further introduce a\nsemantic-enhanced inter- and intra-MCR connection method. We first enhance the\nsemantic consistency and completion of embeddings across different modalities\nfor more robust alignment.

The recent proliferation of hyper-realistic deepfake videos\nhas drawn attention to the threat of audio and visual forgeries. Most previous\nwork on detecting AI-generated fake videos only utilizes visual modality or\naudio modality. While there are some methods in the literature that exploit\naudio and visual modalities to detect forged videos, they have not been\ncomprehensively evaluated on multi-modal datasets of deepfake videos involving\nacoustic and visual manipulations. Moreover, these existing methods are mostly\nbased on CNN and suffer from low detection accuracy. Inspired by the recent\nsuccess of Transformer in various fields, to address the challenges posed by\ndeepfake technology, in this paper, we propose an Audio-Visual\nTransformer-based Ensemble Network (AVTENet) framework that considers both\nacoustic manipulation and visual manipulation to achieve effective video\nforgery detection. Specifically, the proposed model integrates several purely\ntransformer-based variants that capture video, audio, and audio-visual salient\ncues to reach a consensus in prediction. For evaluation, we use the recently\nreleased benchmark multi-modal audio-video FakeAVCeleb dataset.

In this\nwork, SE models are trained and tested on a number of different languages, with\nself-supervised representations which themselves are trained using different\nlanguage combinations and with differing network structures as loss function\nrepresentations.

SED mainly relies on\ntemporal dependencies to distinguish different sound classes, while DoA\nestimation depends on spatial correlations to estimate source directions. To\njointly optimize two subtasks, the SELD system should extract spatial\ncorrelations and model temporal dependencies simultaneously. However, numerous\nmodels mainly extract spatial correlations and model temporal dependencies\nseparately. In this paper, the interdependence of spatial-temporal information\nin audio signals is exploited for simultaneous extraction to enhance the model\nperformance. In response, a novel graph representation leveraging graph\nconvolutional network (GCN) in non-Euclidean space is developed to extract\nspatial-temporal information concurrently. A sliding-window graph (SwG) module\nis designed based on the graph representation. It exploits sliding-windows with\ndifferent sizes to learn temporal context information and dynamically\nconstructs graph vertices in the frequency-channel (F-C) domain to capture\nspatial correlations. Furthermore, as the cornerstone of message passing, a\nrobust Conv2dAgg function is proposed and embedded into the SwG module to\naggregate the features of neighbor vertices. To improve the performance of SELD\nin a natural spatial acoustic environment, a general and efficient SwG-former\nmodel is proposed by integrating the SwG module with the Conformer. It exhibits\nsuperior performance in comparison to recent advanced SELD models. To further\nvalidate the generality and efficiency of the SwG-former, it is seamlessly\nintegrated into the event-independent network version 2 (EINV2) called\nSwG-EINV2.

On the other hand, MFCCGAN_13k also achieved high SNR=27 which is\nequal to that of AC3_128k, and AAC_112k while having a significantly lower\nbitrate (13 kbps). MFCCGAN_36k achieved higher NISQA-MOS results compared to\nAAC_48k while having a 20% lower bitrate. Furthermore, MFCCGAN_13k obtained\nNISQAMOS= 3.9 which is much higher than AAC_24k, AAC_32k, AC3_32k, and AAC_48k.\nFor future work, we finally suggest adopting loss functions optimizing\nintelligibility and perceptual metrics in the MFCCGAN structure to improve\nquality and intelligibility simultaneously.\n","authors":["Mohammad Reza Hasanabadi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14300v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted in ABU Technical Review journal 2023/3"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15631v3","updated":"2023-10-22T13:03:09Z","published":"2022-10-27T17:21:14Z","title":"Exploring Effective Distillation of Self-Supervised Speech Models for\n  Automatic Speech Recognition","summary":"  Recent years have witnessed great strides in self-supervised learning (SSL)\non the speech processing.

Our\nproposed DMU demonstrates superior temporal modeling capabilities across a\nbroad range of sequential modeling tasks, utilizing considerably fewer\nparameters than other state-of-the-art gated RNN models in applications such as\nspeech recognition, radar gesture recognition, ECG waveform segmentation, and\npermuted sequential image classification.\n","authors":["Pengfei Sun","Jibin Wu","Malu Zhang","Paul Devos","Dick Botteldooren"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14982v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14954v1","updated":"2023-10-23T13:55:49Z","published":"2023-10-23T13:55:49Z","title":"Key Frame Mechanism For Efficient Conformer Based End-to-end Speech\n  Recognition","summary":"  Recently, Conformer as a backbone network for end-to-end automatic speech\nrecognition achieved state-of-the-art performance. The Conformer block\nleverages a self-attention mechanism to capture global information, along with\na convolutional neural network to capture local information, resulting in\nimproved performance. However, the Conformer-based model encounters an issue\nwith the self-attention mechanism, as computational complexity grows\nquadratically with the length of the input sequence. Inspired by previous\nConnectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) guided blank skipping during\ndecoding, we introduce intermediate CTC outputs as guidance into the\ndownsampling procedure of the Conformer encoder. We define the frame with\nnon-blank output as key frame. Specifically, we introduce the key frame-based\nself-attention (KFSA) mechanism, a novel method to reduce the computation of\nthe self-attention mechanism using key frames. The structure of our proposed\napproach comprises two encoders. Following the initial encoder, we introduce an\nintermediate CTC loss function to compute the label frame, enabling us to\nextract the key frames and blank frames for KFSA.

In the present paper, we\ndescribe a new neural network-based forced alignment system, the Mason-Alberta\nPhonetic Segmenter (MAPS). The MAPS aligner serves as a testbed for two\npossible improvements we pursue for forced alignment systems. The first is\ntreating the acoustic model in a forced aligner as a tagging task, rather than\na classification task, motivated by the common understanding that segments in\nspeech are not truly discrete and commonly overlap. The second is an\ninterpolation technique to allow boundaries more precise than the common 10 ms\nlimit in modern forced alignment systems. We compare configurations of our\nsystem to a state-of-the-art system, the Montreal Forced Aligner. The tagging\napproach did not generally yield improved results over the Montreal Forced\nAligner. However, a system with the interpolation technique had a 27.92%\nincrease relative to the Montreal Forced Aligner in the amount of boundaries\nwithin 10 ms of the target on the test set. We also reflect on the task and\ntraining process for acoustic modeling in forced alignment, highlighting how\nthe output targets for these models do not match phoneticians' conception of\nsimilarity between phones and that reconciliation of this tension may require\nrethinking the task and output targets or how speech itself should be\nsegmented.\n","authors":["Matthew C.

While using two unimodal\ndetectors can detect audio-visual deepfakes, cross-modal forgery clues could be\noverlooked. Existing multimodal deepfake detection methods typically establish\ncorrespondence between the audio and visual modalities for binary real/fake\nclassification, and require the co-occurrence of both modalities. However, in\nreal-world multi-modal applications, missing modality scenarios may occur where\neither modality is unavailable. In such cases, audio-visual detection methods\nare less practical than two independent unimodal methods. Consequently, the\ndetector can not always obtain the number or type of manipulated modalities\nbeforehand, necessitating a fake-modality-agnostic audio-visual detector. In\nthis work, we introduce a comprehensive framework that is agnostic to fake\nmodalities, which facilitates the identification of multimodal deepfakes and\nhandles situations with missing modalities, regardless of the manipulations\nembedded in audio, video, or even cross-modal forms. To enhance the modeling of\ncross-modal forgery clues, we employ audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) as\na preliminary task. This efficiently extracts speech correlations across\nmodalities, a feature challenging for deepfakes to replicate. Additionally, we\npropose a dual-label detection approach that follows the structure of AVSR to\nsupport the independent detection of each modality.

These tools are\ncommonplace in phonetics to facilitate the use of speech data that would be\ninfeasible to manually transcribe and segment. In the present paper, we\ndescribe a new neural network-based forced alignment system, the Mason-Alberta\nPhonetic Segmenter (MAPS). The MAPS aligner serves as a testbed for two\npossible improvements we pursue for forced alignment systems. The first is\ntreating the acoustic model in a forced aligner as a tagging task, rather than\na classification task, motivated by the common understanding that segments in\nspeech are not truly discrete and commonly overlap. The second is an\ninterpolation technique to allow boundaries more precise than the common 10 ms\nlimit in modern forced alignment systems. We compare configurations of our\nsystem to a state-of-the-art system, the Montreal Forced Aligner. The tagging\napproach did not generally yield improved results over the Montreal Forced\nAligner. However, a system with the interpolation technique had a 27.92%\nincrease relative to the Montreal Forced Aligner in the amount of boundaries\nwithin 10 ms of the target on the test set. We also reflect on the task and\ntraining process for acoustic modeling in forced alignment, highlighting how\nthe output targets for these models do not match phoneticians' conception of\nsimilarity between phones and that reconciliation of this tension may require\nrethinking the task and output targets or how speech itself should be\nsegmented.\n","authors":["Matthew C.

Inspired by the\nrecent success of large language models (LLMs) in task automation, we develop a\nsystem, named MusicAgent, which integrates numerous music-related tools and an\nautonomous workflow to address user requirements.

SSOBA places audio object samples in such a way that\nallows audiences to easily individualize their chosen audio sources according\nto their interests and needs. SSOBA is an extra service and not an alternative,\nso it is also compliant with legacy audio players. The biggest advantage of\nSSOBA is that it does not require any special additional hardware in the\nbroadcasting chain and it is therefore easy to implement and equip legacy\nplayers and decoders with enhanced ability. Input audio objects, number of\noutput channels and sampling rates are three important factors affecting SSOBA\nperformance and specifying it to be lossless or lossy. SSOBA adopts\ninterpolation at the decoder side to compensate for eliminated samples. Both\nsubjective and objective experiments are carried out to evaluate the output\nresults at each step. MUSHRA subjective experiments conducted after the\nencoding step shows good-quality performance of SSOBA with up to five objects.\nSNR measurements and objective experiments, performed after decoding and\ninterpolation, show significant successful recovery and separation of audio\nobjects.
